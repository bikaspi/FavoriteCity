      <h2>About Sydney</h2>
      <p>
        Sydney is the largest and most populous city in Australia and the state
        capital of New South Wales. Sydney is located on Australia's south-east
        coast of the Tasman Sea. Inhabitants of Sydney are called Sydneysiders,
        comprising a cosmopolitan and international population of people from
        numerous places around the world. The city is built on hills surrounding
        Port Jackson which is commonly known as Sydney Harbour, where the iconic
        Sydney Opera House and the Harbour Bridge feature prominently. The
        hinterland of the metropolitan area is surrounded by national parks, and
        the coastal regions feature many bays, rivers, inlets and beaches
        including the famous Bondi Beach.

        <h3><b>Sydney Opera House</b></h3>
        <p>
          The Sydney Opera House is more than just an architectural marvel set
          on beautiful Sydney Harbour, it's also a world-class working opera
          house. The iconic sails host more than 1,600 performances a year –
          everything from classical ballet performances, innovative theatre and
          symphony music to contemporary dance and, of course, stunning opera
          productions. The UNESCO World Heritage-listed building offers daily
          guided tours, available in English, Mandarin, French, German,
          Japanese, Korean and Spanish. Meanwhile, Opera Bar has the best view
          in town, letting you sip cocktails as you marvel at the Sydney Harbour
          Bridge. You’ll treasure the same views dining alfresco at the adjacent
          House Canteen.

        <h3><b>Sydney Harbor Bridge</b></h3>
        <p>
          The Sydney Harbour Bridge is one of the world’s most recognisable
          landmarks. Not only is it the largest steel arch bridge on the planet,
          but it also spans one of the globe’s finest natural harbours.
          Affectionately named the ‘Coathanger’ by locals, it’s an intrinsic
          part of the city; you can walk or cycle across it and even climb to
          its peak for incredible views.

        <h3><b>Bondi Beach</b></h3>
        <p>
          Sparkling blue ocean, funky eateries and a laid-back beach lifestyle
          sum up the world-famous Bondi. Go for a swim in an iconic ocean pool
          at Icebergs, sip a fruity cocktail at a beachside bar like Hotel
          Ravesis, learn to ride the waves with the experts at Let’s Go Surfing
          or peruse the Saturday farmer’s markets. Of course, the Bondi to
          Coogee Coastal Walk is a memorable way to appreciate the beauty of the
          area. The picturesque 6km track is carved into sandstone cliffs and
          offers uninterrupted views of the ocean, passing Tamarama Beach and
          Bronte Beach, before finishing in beautiful Coogee. Throughout October
          and November, you will also be able to view the world’s biggest annual
          free outdoor sculpture exhibition – Sculpture by the Sea – along the
          route.

        <h3><b>Royal Botanic Garden</b></h3>
        <p>
          An oasis of 30 hectares in the heart of the city, the Royal Botanic
          Garden occupies one of Sydney’s most spectacular positions: wrapping
          around the harbour and sitting adjacent to the Sydney Opera House.
          With a long history dating back to 1816, it is home to an outstanding
          collection of plants from Australia and overseas. Enjoy a stroll, pack
          a picnic lunch, join a free guided tour (the Aboriginal Heritage Tour
          is a highlight) or come for one of the many memorable events held in
          the lush antipodean-accented parklands.
